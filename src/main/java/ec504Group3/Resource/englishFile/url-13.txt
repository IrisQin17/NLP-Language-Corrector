Read the Update  Drupal Camps are starting to go virtual. It's a great time to connect with people all over the world. Find Virtual Events Deliver a powerful digital experience your customers will remember. Learn why Acquia was named a Leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms. Provide robust retail that's adaptable to an ever-changing demand Empower & protect account holders Bring fans to their feet Render any front-end experience built on a decoupled Drupal solution Entice and inspire A digital presence as advanced as you are Provide powerful and flexible solutions for your ecommerce workflows Advance your mission Healing healthcare IT pain Empowering universities around the globe Content at your audience's fingertips Engage citizens around the globe Secure & protect your users Perform under pressure Allow seamless translation Target your reach with audience customization Integrate a diverse yet simplified ecosystem of multichannel messaging Turn customer data into one-to-one custom experiences Decouple your front-end & back-end to scale content across silos NYU Steinhardt worked with Four Kitchens to consolidate the university’s multiple sites and experiences into one cohesive, engaging user experience. Drupal's component design and templating capabilities were crucial in developing an improved user experience. ACLU called on Tag1’s Technical Architecture and Leadership to perform emergency support and rescue work to get the ACLU Action website back online as quickly as possible and to help it withstand even bigger traffic spikes in the future. Migrating 20 club sites onto a single Drupal site was no small task. Major League Soccer needed highly sophisticated customization options based on each team’s design, content priorities, and site maintainers’ capabilities. Working closely with the engineering and design teams at Pinterest, Phase2 architected a Drupal 8 system to elevate their global brand and drive growth via a new suite of marketing, business, and community sites. This group had the goal of creating a digital platform that was cost-effective, yet provided the best possible customer experience. For YMCAs with smaller digital budgets or teams, this allows any association to have a top-tier website for little investment, and YMCAs with larger digital budgets were able to innovate and expand, thus, Drupal 8 built a better platform for everyone. Today we officially launch the #DrupalCares campaign across Drupal.org to organize the fundraising effort across our Drupal Community. Our goal is to raise $500,000 to secure the future of the Drupal Association. The Drupal 9.0.0 release is coming soon, and we're inviting developers to help us test it! Drupal 9 betas are for testing sites and projects with the upcoming Drupal 9.0 release. They are not for production. Today, I'm asking for your financial support for the Drupal Association. As we all know, we are living in unprecedented times, and the Drupal Association needs our help. With DrupalCon being postponed or potentially canceled, there will be a significant financial impact on our beloved non-profit. The Drupal Association thanks Acquia for being the #1 contributor to Drupal - With Acquia you can build, run, and optimize sites on the only Digital Experience Platform that's made for Drupal.
