ACLU called on Tag1’s Technical Architecture and Leadership to perform emergency support and rescue work to get the ACLU Action website back online as quickly as possible and to help it withstand even bigger traffic spikes in the future. Migrating 20 club sites onto a single Drupal site was no small task. Major League Soccer needed highly sophisticated customization options based on each team’s design, content priorities, and site maintainers’ capabilities. Working closely with the engineering and design teams at Pinterest, Phase2 architected a Drupal 8 system to elevate their global brand and drive growth via a new suite of marketing, business, and community sites. This group had the goal of creating a digital platform that was cost-effective, yet provided the best possible customer experience. For YMCAs with smaller digital budgets or teams, this allows any association to have a top-tier website for little investment, and YMCAs with larger digital budgets were able to innovate and expand, thus, Drupal 8 built a better platform for everyone. Today we officially launch the #DrupalCares campaign across Drupal.org to organize the fundraising effort across our Drupal Community. Our goal is to raise $500,000 to secure the future of the Drupal Association. The Drupal 9.0.0 release is coming soon, and we're inviting developers to help us test it! Drupal 9 betas are for testing sites and projects with the upcoming Drupal 9.0 release. They are not for production. Today, I'm asking for your financial support for the Drupal Association. As we all know, we are living in unprecedented times, and the Drupal Association needs our help. With DrupalCon being postponed or potentially canceled, there will be a significant financial impact on our beloved non-profit. The Drupal Association thanks Acquia for being the #1 contributor to Drupal - With Acquia you can build, run, and optimize sites on the only Digital Experience Platform that's made for Drupal.

Como no existe una máquina que pueda mostrarnos lo que sucedió hace cientos de años, nos aferramos a los apellidos. Nos identifican, pero también suponen un legado que se transmite de padres a hijos. El hilo conductor de nuestra historia. José María Arrazola, un vasco de 71 años, se dedicó durante décadas al marketing. Cada vez que visitaba una ciudad repasaba la guía telefónica en busca de algún pariente lejano. “En Chicago conocí a un conductor de autobús guatemalteco con mi apellido. Y en Nueva York encontré a otras 17 personas”. Durante unas vacaciones por Castilla-La Mancha descubrió la casa rural Arrazola. Gracias a ella llegó hasta Checa, un pueblo de Guadalajara de apenas 300 habitantes que concentra el mayor porcentaje de personas con ese apellido en el planeta: una de cada tres. Aquel viaje cambió su vida. Un primo le puso en contacto con José Ramón Arrazola, un jubilado de 70 años que lleva buceando más de dos décadas en la genealogía familiar. Ambos viajaron hasta Checa, entablaron amistad con sus vecinos y en 2014 organizaron un encuentro en la localidad para reunir a sus parientes. Acudieron más de doscientas personas llegadas de toda España, pero también desde el extranjero. El éxito de la iniciativa les hizo institucionalizar un encuentro bianual. “Hay gente que se reúne porque es fan de Madonna y nosotros nos juntamos con personas con nuestro apellido. No veo nada extraño”, subraya José María. La segunda edición, en 2016, se celebró en Oñati (Gipuzkoa), cuna del apellido; dos años más tarde se organizó en Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) y la próxima estaba prevista del 1 al 3 de mayo en Bruselas. La crisis del coronavirus ha obligado a posponer la cita, que se celebrará el año que viene. “No estoy triste. Hemos aportado el dinero del viaje poco a poco y este retraso quizás anime a más personas”, se consuela José María, urdidor de estas convocatorias, cada vez más multitudinarias gracias a la creación de una página web. La labor divulgativa corre a cargo de José Ramón, que hace cuatro años publicó un libro donde recoge la historia definitiva del apellido: Sobre los Arrazola. Apuntes de genealogía y heráldica. “Es muy bonito proporcionar a la gente sus orígenes. Muchos llegan con grandes expectativas. Son personas a las que no le ha ido muy bien la vida y necesitan compensarlo con un pasado glorioso. Pero no hay nada de eso. Nuestros orígenes son humildes”. Según las investigaciones de José Ramón, Arrazola, que en vasco significa sitio de piedra, es un apellido toponímico que procede de una antigua localidad que a mediados del siglo XX se integró en el municipio vizcaíno de Atxondo. El primer Arrazola documentado en el archivo municipal de Oñati data de 1516. “Deben de existir varias ramas, así que puede que no tengamos la misma raíz biológica, pero el origen de todos los linajes está en los caseríos del barrio de Olabarrieta de Oñati”, explica este aparejador jubilado. De ahí partieron a otros lugares y ahora se contabilizan más de 10.000 personas con ese apellido en todo el mundo. El 40% vive en México, pero también los hay en Bolivia, Colombia, Argentina, Bélgica o Estados Unidos. En España apenas son 650, según datos del Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE). La mayoría están censados en el pueblo que organizó el primer encuentro. José Ramón relata que Sancho Arrazola salió de Oñati en 1522 para trabajar de herrero en Checa. Muchos siglos antes, los romanos ya se habían asentado en la zona para aprovechar su riqueza mineral. “En la Edad Media reabrieron las minas de hierro y eso atrajo a muchos vascos, que era mano de obra especializada. Tenemos apellidos como Oñati y Arauz, pero los Arrazola son los que más han proliferado”, explica Jesús Alba, alcalde de Checa. De los 287 censados en el municipio, más de 60 lo tienen como primer apellido, otros como segundo. El abuelo paterno del regidor, su madre y su esposa también lo llevan. La plaza principal del pueblo está dedicada a Lorenzo Arrazola, un lugareño que ocupó en seis ocasiones la cartera de Gracia y Justicia y que logró presidir el Consejo de Ministros en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX. “Debieron de llegar varias personas desde el norte. Lorenzo no tiene vinculación con mi familia a pesar de que somos del mismo sitio y compartimos apellido”, indica Juan Francisco, de 38 años. Él no se ha perdido ninguno de los tres encuentros. “Es una experiencia única. En el último viaje cruzamos el charco para encontrarnos con gente desconocida y compartir momentos emocionantes. Nos hemos convertido en una gran familia”. Debido a las excepcionales circunstancias, EL PAÍS está ofreciendo gratuitamente todos sus contenidos digitales.

Hemos aportado el dinero del viaje poco a poco y este retraso quizás anime a más personas”, se consuela José María, urdidor de estas convocatorias, cada vez más multitudinarias gracias a la creación de una página web. La labor divulgativa corre a cargo de José Ramón, que hace cuatro años publicó un libro donde recoge la historia definitiva del apellido: Sobre los Arrazola. Apuntes de genealogía y heráldica. “Es muy bonito proporcionar a la gente sus orígenes. Muchos llegan con grandes expectativas. Son personas a las que no le ha ido muy bien la vida y necesitan compensarlo con un pasado glorioso. Pero no hay nada de eso. Nuestros orígenes son humildes”. Según las investigaciones de José Ramón, Arrazola, que en vasco significa sitio de piedra, es un apellido toponímico que procede de una antigua localidad que a mediados del siglo XX se integró en el municipio vizcaíno de Atxondo. El primer Arrazola documentado en el archivo municipal de Oñati data de 1516. “Deben de existir varias ramas, así que puede que no tengamos la misma raíz biológica, pero el origen de todos los linajes está en los caseríos del barrio de Olabarrieta de Oñati”, explica este aparejador jubilado. De ahí partieron a otros lugares y ahora se contabilizan más de 10.000 personas con ese apellido en todo el mundo. El 40% vive en México, pero también los hay en Bolivia, Colombia, Argentina, Bélgica o Estados Unidos. En España apenas son 650, según datos del Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE). La mayoría están censados en el pueblo que organizó el primer encuentro. José Ramón relata que Sancho Arrazola salió de Oñati en 1522 para trabajar de herrero en Checa. Muchos siglos antes, los romanos ya se habían asentado en la zona para aprovechar su riqueza mineral. “En la Edad Media reabrieron las minas de hierro y eso atrajo a muchos vascos, que era mano de obra especializada. Tenemos apellidos como Oñati y Arauz, pero los Arrazola son los que más han proliferado”, explica Jesús Alba, alcalde de Checa. De los 287 censados en el municipio, más de 60 lo tienen como primer apellido, otros como segundo. El abuelo paterno del regidor, su madre y su esposa también lo llevan. La plaza principal del pueblo está dedicada a Lorenzo Arrazola, un lugareño que ocupó en seis ocasiones la cartera de Gracia y Justicia y que logró presidir el Consejo de Ministros en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX. “Debieron de llegar varias personas desde el norte. Lorenzo no tiene vinculación con mi familia a pesar de que somos del mismo sitio y compartimos apellido”, indica Juan Francisco, de 38 años. Él no se ha perdido ninguno de los tres encuentros. “Es una experiencia única. En el último viaje cruzamos el charco para encontrarnos con gente desconocida y compartir momentos emocionantes. Nos hemos convertido en una gran familia”. Debido a las excepcionales circunstancias, EL PAÍS está ofreciendo gratuitamente todos sus contenidos digitales.
