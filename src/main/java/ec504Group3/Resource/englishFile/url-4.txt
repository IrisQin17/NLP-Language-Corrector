Usar como aparato de ejercicio un objeto que sirve primordialmente para descansar puede sonar insólito. En Yucatán, una mujer usó una hamaca para crear un programa de ejercicios al que llamó “Hamaca Gym”. El video ha sido retomado por varias páginas y una de sus versiones superó los 1,7 millones de reproducciones en los primeros dos días tras su publicación.  Su creadora es una actriz y dramaturga yucateca que trata de buscar opciones de entretenimiento para pasar los días de cuarentena. “Si puedes tener sexo en una hamaca, también puedes ejercitarte”, dice a Verne Conchi León, quien usó su hamaca para crear seis ejercicios con un toque de humor para quienes tengan una hamaca en casa. Algunos son tan sencillos como la ‘flor de elote’, que es una versión de la ‘flor de loto’ clásica del yoga, pero sobre la hamaca, y otros tan complicados como ‘el paso de la muerte’ que consiste en hacer resistencia con todo el cuerpo sobre la hamaca. “No olviden sonreír”, dice León al hacer referencia a la actriz Bárbara de Regil. Pero eso sí, hay que tener mucho cuidado al hacer esta rutina. "La hamaca tiene que ser resistente y estar sujeta a una pared con fuerza y cuidar que tenga buenos cimientos", dice León. "Para los primerizos, lo mejor es poner un colchón abajo, para evitar un golpe", recomienda. La hamaca es muy común en las casas de las península de Yucatán. “En la hamaca nacemos, tenemos sexo y si la vida es buena, moriremos en ella en casa y tranquilos”, reflexiona León. En Mérida, no todos han respetado la cuarentena, por lo que la actriz busca difundir mensajes para que las personas se queden en casa y pasen tiempo en familia y con diversión. “Poner la hamaca y quedarse en casa, cocinar y estar en tiempos con uno mismo”, dice. “Y qué mejor con unos ejercicios para bajar la panza antes de una cochinita pibil”, comenta. La dramaturga de 42 años cuenta que la contingencia sanitaria por la covid-19 le ha frenado varios proyectos artísticos, pero considera que ejercitarse y fomentar el sentido del humor es importante para pasar la cuarentena. “El coronavirus no llega a las hamacas si nos quedamos en casa”, comenta. ...

En Yucatán, una mujer usó una hamaca para crear un programa de ejercicios al que llamó “Hamaca Gym”. El video ha sido retomado por varias páginas y una de sus versiones superó los 1,7 millones de reproducciones en los primeros dos días tras su publicación.  Su creadora es una actriz y dramaturga yucateca que trata de buscar opciones de entretenimiento para pasar los días de cuarentena. “Si puedes tener sexo en una hamaca, también puedes ejercitarte”, dice a Verne Conchi León, quien usó su hamaca para crear seis ejercicios con un toque de humor para quienes tengan una hamaca en casa. Algunos son tan sencillos como la ‘flor de elote’, que es una versión de la ‘flor de loto’ clásica del yoga, pero sobre la hamaca, y otros tan complicados como ‘el paso de la muerte’ que consiste en hacer resistencia con todo el cuerpo sobre la hamaca. “No olviden sonreír”, dice León al hacer referencia a la actriz Bárbara de Regil. Pero eso sí, hay que tener mucho cuidado al hacer esta rutina. "La hamaca tiene que ser resistente y estar sujeta a una pared con fuerza y cuidar que tenga buenos cimientos", dice León. "Para los primerizos, lo mejor es poner un colchón abajo, para evitar un golpe", recomienda. La hamaca es muy común en las casas de las península de Yucatán. “En la hamaca nacemos, tenemos sexo y si la vida es buena, moriremos en ella en casa y tranquilos”, reflexiona León. En Mérida, no todos han respetado la cuarentena, por lo que la actriz busca difundir mensajes para que las personas se queden en casa y pasen tiempo en familia y con diversión. “Poner la hamaca y quedarse en casa, cocinar y estar en tiempos con uno mismo”, dice. “Y qué mejor con unos ejercicios para bajar la panza antes de una cochinita pibil”, comenta. La dramaturga de 42 años cuenta que la contingencia sanitaria por la covid-19 le ha frenado varios proyectos artísticos, pero considera que ejercitarse y fomentar el sentido del humor es importante para pasar la cuarentena. “El coronavirus no llega a las hamacas si nos quedamos en casa”, comenta. ...
