Aún es pronto para predecir cuáles serán los principales cambios derivados de la covid-19 y en qué sentido operarán, pero ya podemos apreciar cómo la crisis sanitaria ha acelerado otros procesos que ya se estaban fraguando. En el entorno de las galerías de arte contemporáneo, esos cambios nos llevaban hacia la polarización entre unas pocas y poderosas franquicias internacionales y una constelación de pequeños establecimientos centrados en artistas emergentes o de ámbito local, todos ellos en una constante peregrinación de feria en feria, pues ahí era donde realmente se cerraban las operaciones. En cambio, las ventas dentro de los espacios permanentes suponían una parte marginal del negocio. En paralelo a esto, no ha dejado de crecer la facturación online, aunque no haya alcanzado aún una proporción tan significativa: según el informe de mercado encargado por la feria Art Basel a la experta Clare McAndrew, en 2019 las ventas de arte por internet suponían el 9% del total. Sin embargo, está por ver a cuánto asciende esta proporción en 2020, con los espacios físicos cerrados y, sobre todo, con la mayor parte de la agenda de ferias cancelada o en suspenso. De vuelta al mundo material, la sede de la galería Hauser & Wirth en Menorca es uno de los proyectos de arte y arquitectura más estimulantes que últimamente se han emprendido en nuestro país. Desde que hace casi un año se anunciara la noticia de su apertura, la expectación no ha dejado de crecer, y con razón. Convertida desde hace años en una de esas grandes franquicias de las que antes hablábamos, Hauser & Wirth ya poseía espacios en Zúrich, Londres, Nueva York, Los Ángeles, Hong Kong, Somerset (Inglaterra) y las estaciones de esquí de Gstaad y Saint Moritz, en Suiza. Entre sus representados se cuentan artistas como Jenny Holzer, Paul McCarthy o Louise Bourgeois. Además, en nuestro país ha colaborado en la reapertura de Chillida Leku, el centro de arte dedicado a la obra del escultor Eduardo Chillida, cuyo legado también representa. Este mismo verano estaba previsto que abriera el nuevo centro, ubicado en un hospital militar del siglo XVIII en la isla del Rey, en el puerto de Mahón. Pero los responsables de la galería nos confirman que las fechas que ahora manejan nos llevan hasta la primavera de 2021. Sin embargo, a finales de este mismo mes –la fecha exacta aún no se ha cerrado– podremos disfrutar de un adelanto por obra y gracia de la realidad virtual. HWVR (Hauser & Wirth Virtual Reality) es un proyecto desarrollado a través de ArtLab, el programa de investigación e innovación creado por la galería para explorar las intersecciones entre arte y tecnología. Se trata de una herramienta informática que permitirá desarrollar y visualizar las exposiciones de la galería en un entorno digital en 3D. Y para su presentación al público se ha optado por una exposición virtual precisamente en el espacio menorquín, que fuera de las pantallas digitales aún se encuentra en construcción. Está previsto mantener la exposición online hasta finales de 2020. El arquitecto argentino Luis Laplace es el autor de la reforma que está adaptando el hospital a las necesidades de un centro de arte. Como colaborador habitual de Hauser & Wirth, ya se encargó de actualizar Chillida Leku, y ahora ha trabajado junto al equipo desarrollador de HWVR. En conversación telefónica desde su estudio de París, nos avanza qué aspecto tendrá lo que podremos ver en un par de semanas: "Como arquitecto, estoy acostumbrado a trabajar con herramientas en 3D que me permiten obtener una imagen muy realista pero estática, pero este no es ahora el caso. Aquí la imagen es casi de videojuego, dinámica, lo que permitirá al público recorrer el espacio, ver cómo las piezas se integran en él, contemplarlas de más lejos o más cerca, rodearlas, etcétera. Hay expectación por ver el resultado, también por nuestra parte". Iwan Wirth, uno de los propietarios de la galería junto a su esposa Manuela Wirth y la madre de esta, la coleccionista Ursula Hauser, manifiesta su confianza en ese resultado. "Hauser & Wirth tiene una creencia muy arraigada en la innovación, eso es parte de nuestro ADN", nos explica. "Y vemos esta nueva herramienta como un cambio de juego para nuestros artistas y la industria". Más allá del impacto de su proyecto, Wirth considera que la actividad de las galerías se enfrenta a cambios inminentes que los nuevos tiempos se han encargado de activar: "Esta crisis se diferencia de todas las demás en que no podemos reunirnos físicamente, por lo que ha revelado la necesidad de mejores herramientas para conectarnos de forma remota. La web, las redes sociales, la realidad virtual y la teleconferencia nos ayudarán a reinventarnos y reconfigurarnos. Nosotros mismos lo hemos comprobado con el éxito de nuestras exposiciones online: la del artista George Condo la vendimos completamente en cuestión de minutos, y esperamos que ocurra lo mismo con la próxima, de Rashid Johnson". El 10% de los beneficios de estas exposiciones se donará al Fondo de Respuesta de la covid-19 de la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Aunque se trate de la más mediática, Hauser & Wirth no es la única galería de arte que estos días ha desarrollado proyectos online. Dada la imposibilidad de exponer y vender in situ o en las ferias –por no hablar de la contracción global del mercado ante la incertidumbre económica–, la supervivencia de estos negocios se ve fuertemente comprometida. Así que no ha quedado otra que aguzar el ingenio y adaptar la actividad a la nueva situación. En esta línea, Carlier Gebauer (con sedes en Berlín y Madrid) ha ideado The Breakfast Club, una iniciativa en la que cada domingo se cuenta con la colaboración de un comisario o crítico distinto para poner en pie una exposición virtual con artistas de la galería. Hasta el momento han intervenido como invitados el italiano Domenico de Chirico, el belga Louis-Philippe Van Eeckhoutte y quien escribe estas líneas. Victoria Solano, directora de la sede española de la galería, emite sus propios pronósticos: "Los canales digitales, que posiblemente estaban infrautilizados, se usarán más para descubrir artistas, y seguro que muchas actividades en línea que han surgido estos días seguirán después del confinamiento; sin embargo, creo que a la hora de realizar ventas seguirá primando la relación directa y personal, se volverá a lo local y al one-to-one entre galerista y artista". En nuestro país, otra de las pioneras fue la galería madrileña Sabrina Amrani, que inauguraba su programa Online Viewing Rooms, que difundía a través de su página web el vídeo Geometría Popular, del artista cubano Dagoberto Rodríguez. La programación ha proseguido con nuevas muestras virtuales de Joël Andrianomearisoa y Mónica de Miranda y ayer se lanzó con una colectiva. También han desarrollado iniciativas online con personalidad propia galerías como Espacio Valverde, que invita al público a realizar obras siguiendo las instrucciones de sus artistas; The Ryder, con el programa #TheRYDERatHOME; o Álvaro Alcázar, Mi Casa, para la que incluso edita un catálogo en formato pdf. Aunque quizá la más peculiar sea No place Like Home, la exposición que acaba de inaugurar la galería valenciana Espai Tactel. Sus propietarios, Ismaël Chappaz y Juanma Menero, viven en la trastienda de la propia galería, lo que les ha permitido desplegar una muestra colectiva de varios de sus artistas en el espacio físico habitual. El público, eso sí, solo accede a ella a través de las imágenes difundidas en la página web. Esta vez la idea es reanudar la actividad normal cuando el propio concepto de lo normal se ha redefinido. En palabras de Chappaz y Menero: "La exposición no es un mero artefacto para cubrir contenidos online, sino que supone una reanudación de nuestra actividad en el marco de esta nueva normalidad". Así que, bajo este modelo, lo virtual es un simple medio para la difusión de una realidad material, como ya ocurría antes de la crisis. En este sentido, se cumple el diagnóstico que realiza Iwan Wirth: "Siempre he creído que el arte y la vida son inseparables. En todo caso, siempre se ha recurrido a artistas y a otras personas creativas para inspirarse frente a tiempos difíciles".

En el entorno de las galerías de arte contemporáneo, esos cambios nos llevaban hacia la polarización entre unas pocas y poderosas franquicias internacionales y una constelación de pequeños establecimientos centrados en artistas emergentes o de ámbito local, todos ellos en una constante peregrinación de feria en feria, pues ahí era donde realmente se cerraban las operaciones. En cambio, las ventas dentro de los espacios permanentes suponían una parte marginal del negocio. En paralelo a esto, no ha dejado de crecer la facturación online, aunque no haya alcanzado aún una proporción tan significativa: según el informe de mercado encargado por la feria Art Basel a la experta Clare McAndrew, en 2019 las ventas de arte por internet suponían el 9% del total. Sin embargo, está por ver a cuánto asciende esta proporción en 2020, con los espacios físicos cerrados y, sobre todo, con la mayor parte de la agenda de ferias cancelada o en suspenso. De vuelta al mundo material, la sede de la galería Hauser & Wirth en Menorca es uno de los proyectos de arte y arquitectura más estimulantes que últimamente se han emprendido en nuestro país. Desde que hace casi un año se anunciara la noticia de su apertura, la expectación no ha dejado de crecer, y con razón. Convertida desde hace años en una de esas grandes franquicias de las que antes hablábamos, Hauser & Wirth ya poseía espacios en Zúrich, Londres, Nueva York, Los Ángeles, Hong Kong, Somerset (Inglaterra) y las estaciones de esquí de Gstaad y Saint Moritz, en Suiza. Entre sus representados se cuentan artistas como Jenny Holzer, Paul McCarthy o Louise Bourgeois. Además, en nuestro país ha colaborado en la reapertura de Chillida Leku, el centro de arte dedicado a la obra del escultor Eduardo Chillida, cuyo legado también representa. Este mismo verano estaba previsto que abriera el nuevo centro, ubicado en un hospital militar del siglo XVIII en la isla del Rey, en el puerto de Mahón. Pero los responsables de la galería nos confirman que las fechas que ahora manejan nos llevan hasta la primavera de 2021. Sin embargo, a finales de este mismo mes –la fecha exacta aún no se ha cerrado– podremos disfrutar de un adelanto por obra y gracia de la realidad virtual. HWVR (Hauser & Wirth Virtual Reality) es un proyecto desarrollado a través de ArtLab, el programa de investigación e innovación creado por la galería para explorar las intersecciones entre arte y tecnología. Se trata de una herramienta informática que permitirá desarrollar y visualizar las exposiciones de la galería en un entorno digital en 3D. Y para su presentación al público se ha optado por una exposición virtual precisamente en el espacio menorquín, que fuera de las pantallas digitales aún se encuentra en construcción. Está previsto mantener la exposición online hasta finales de 2020. El arquitecto argentino Luis Laplace es el autor de la reforma que está adaptando el hospital a las necesidades de un centro de arte. Como colaborador habitual de Hauser & Wirth, ya se encargó de actualizar Chillida Leku, y ahora ha trabajado junto al equipo desarrollador de HWVR. En conversación telefónica desde su estudio de París, nos avanza qué aspecto tendrá lo que podremos ver en un par de semanas: "Como arquitecto, estoy acostumbrado a trabajar con herramientas en 3D que me permiten obtener una imagen muy realista pero estática, pero este no es ahora el caso. Aquí la imagen es casi de videojuego, dinámica, lo que permitirá al público recorrer el espacio, ver cómo las piezas se integran en él, contemplarlas de más lejos o más cerca, rodearlas, etcétera. Hay expectación por ver el resultado, también por nuestra parte". Iwan Wirth, uno de los propietarios de la galería junto a su esposa Manuela Wirth y la madre de esta, la coleccionista Ursula Hauser, manifiesta su confianza en ese resultado. "Hauser & Wirth tiene una creencia muy arraigada en la innovación, eso es parte de nuestro ADN", nos explica. "Y vemos esta nueva herramienta como un cambio de juego para nuestros artistas y la industria". Más allá del impacto de su proyecto, Wirth considera que la actividad de las galerías se enfrenta a cambios inminentes que los nuevos tiempos se han encargado de activar: "Esta crisis se diferencia de todas las demás en que no podemos reunirnos físicamente, por lo que ha revelado la necesidad de mejores herramientas para conectarnos de forma remota. La web, las redes sociales, la realidad virtual y la teleconferencia nos ayudarán a reinventarnos y reconfigurarnos. Nosotros mismos lo hemos comprobado con el éxito de nuestras exposiciones online: la del artista George Condo la vendimos completamente en cuestión de minutos, y esperamos que ocurra lo mismo con la próxima, de Rashid Johnson". El 10% de los beneficios de estas exposiciones se donará al Fondo de Respuesta de la covid-19 de la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Aunque se trate de la más mediática, Hauser & Wirth no es la única galería de arte que estos días ha desarrollado proyectos online. Dada la imposibilidad de exponer y vender in situ o en las ferias –por no hablar de la contracción global del mercado ante la incertidumbre económica–, la supervivencia de estos negocios se ve fuertemente comprometida. Así que no ha quedado otra que aguzar el ingenio y adaptar la actividad a la nueva situación. En esta línea, Carlier Gebauer (con sedes en Berlín y Madrid) ha ideado The Breakfast Club, una iniciativa en la que cada domingo se cuenta con la colaboración de un comisario o crítico distinto para poner en pie una exposición virtual con artistas de la galería. Hasta el momento han intervenido como invitados el italiano Domenico de Chirico, el belga Louis-Philippe Van Eeckhoutte y quien escribe estas líneas. Victoria Solano, directora de la sede española de la galería, emite sus propios pronósticos: "Los canales digitales, que posiblemente estaban infrautilizados, se usarán más para descubrir artistas, y seguro que muchas actividades en línea que han surgido estos días seguirán después del confinamiento; sin embargo, creo que a la hora de realizar ventas seguirá primando la relación directa y personal, se volverá a lo local y al one-to-one entre galerista y artista". En nuestro país, otra de las pioneras fue la galería madrileña Sabrina Amrani, que inauguraba su programa Online Viewing Rooms, que difundía a través de su página web el vídeo Geometría Popular, del artista cubano Dagoberto Rodríguez. La programación ha proseguido con nuevas muestras virtuales de Joël Andrianomearisoa y Mónica de Miranda y ayer se lanzó con una colectiva. También han desarrollado iniciativas online con personalidad propia galerías como Espacio Valverde, que invita al público a realizar obras siguiendo las instrucciones de sus artistas; The Ryder, con el programa #TheRYDERatHOME; o Álvaro Alcázar, Mi Casa, para la que incluso edita un catálogo en formato pdf. Aunque quizá la más peculiar sea No place Like Home, la exposición que acaba de inaugurar la galería valenciana Espai Tactel. Sus propietarios, Ismaël Chappaz y Juanma Menero, viven en la trastienda de la propia galería, lo que les ha permitido desplegar una muestra colectiva de varios de sus artistas en el espacio físico habitual. El público, eso sí, solo accede a ella a través de las imágenes difundidas en la página web. Esta vez la idea es reanudar la actividad normal cuando el propio concepto de lo normal se ha redefinido. En palabras de Chappaz y Menero: "La exposición no es un mero artefacto para cubrir contenidos online, sino que supone una reanudación de nuestra actividad en el marco de esta nueva normalidad". Así que, bajo este modelo, lo virtual es un simple medio para la difusión de una realidad material, como ya ocurría antes de la crisis. En este sentido, se cumple el diagnóstico que realiza Iwan Wirth: "Siempre he creído que el arte y la vida son inseparables. En todo caso, siempre se ha recurrido a artistas y a otras personas creativas para inspirarse frente a tiempos difíciles".
