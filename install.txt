        For Mac OS:
            Homebrew
            When installing ArangoDB via the macOS package manager Homebrew, only the Community Edition is available.

            The Homebrew installation is updated a few days after the official release of a new version.

            If you are using homebrew, then you can install the latest released stable version of ArangoDB using brew as follows:

            brew install arangodb
            This will install the current stable version of ArangoDB and all dependencies within your Homebrew tree. Note that the server will be installed as:

            /usr/local/Cellar/arangodb/<VERSION>/sbin/arangod
            <VERSION> is a placeholder for the actual version number, e.g. 3.5.0.

            You can start the server by running the command:

            /usr/local/Cellar/arangodb/<VERSION>/sbin/arangod &
            Configuration file is located at:

            /usr/local/etc/arangodb3/arangod.conf
            The ArangoDB shell will be installed as:

            /usr/local/Cellar/arangodb/<VERSION>/bin/arangosh
            You can uninstall ArangoDB using:

            brew uninstall arangodb
            However, in case you started ArangoDB using the launchctl, you need to unload it before uninstalling the server:

            launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.arangodb.plist
            Then remove the LaunchAgent:

            rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.arangodb.plist
            If the latest ArangoDB version is not shown in Homebrew, you also need to update Homebrew executing the command brew update.

        Windows:
            please follow the instructions on the website:
                https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/installation-windows.html

Supporting files
- A list of non-standard libraries needed for your project to run, including:
    - Dependency for arangodb, stanfordNLP, log4j,.etc in Maven project structure concluded in pom.xml. (Users need to click on "import changes" for these dependencies in IDE)
    - Java swing, awt and etc. libraries for UI display
- Examples of how to use your project
    - Database Setup:
        - Make sure the arangoDB is successfully installed on your system and arangodb database service is successfully set up on your system.
        - Use "127.0.0.1:8529" to make HTTPs request in your own browser. The operation can be simply accessing the 127.0.0.1:8529 by your local browser.
        - After accessing this IP:port, a login site will occur in your browser.
        - Use login name as "root" and password as "" to login.
        - After logged in, add a new graph named "allston" in graph page, with edge definition as "freqs", from collection as "words" and to coleection as "words".
    - Currently GUI window is used and is successfully combined with our core algorithm and structure
    - Users now could simply run the "test.java" in "group3/src/main/java/ec504Group3/test.java" directory to view the whole crawler-database-checker processes.
    - As you can see in our GUI part, there are several language choices you can choose to correct a specific language.
    - After choosing a specific language, you need to enter in legal input into two text fields below which are "crawler URL List file" and "checker file".
    - Currently legal input is "src/main/java/ec504Group3/Resource/URL-list" and "external/taggers/input/english-input.txt"
    - After typing in the legal file path, you could click the button "enter" or you could press button "reset" to re-type the file path. (Database setup is required)
    - After some time of running, the result will be shown on the text Area on GUI
- Descriptions of testing patterns, and instructions on how to exercise them:
    - test:
        - The URL https://www.rndsystems.com/cn is chosen as the original URL. Then we crawler several URLs from this URL and store them into URL-list file. Then for each line (URL) in this file, we crawler the data and dump them into local files. In the test, we successfully store 15 files locally.
        - Transferring each file into token type and get the pos tag of each word in the file by using StanfordNLP.api.
        - Information is successfully stored into graph database.
        - One checkfile is created in CheckFile directory and its content is also transferred to token type.
        - Token type pairs in check file are checked in order based on our algorithm for searching frequency in the graph database.
        - The error rate in our dictionary is about 0.002% in 15 files.
        - We deliberately make some mistakes in checkfile. And the test result shows out our algorithm works well since some sentences with mistakes do has some reasonable suspicion scores.
        - Some example results:
            - {With DrupalCon being postponed or potentially canceled there will be a significant financial impact on our beloved nonprofit } score: 10
            - {Because we all have different needs Drupal allows you to create a unique space in a world of cookiecutter solutions } score: 10
            - {We 're the leading opensource CMS for ambitious digital experiences that reach your audience across multiple channels } score: 0
            - {She is responsible for organizing and motivating a worldwide collective dedicated to Internet openness } score: 20
        - As you can see, our suspicion score is reasonable

Execution
- Import the corresponding dependencies in IDE correctly.
- Make sure the arangoDB is successfully installed on your system and arangodb database service is successfully set up on your system.
- Use "127.0.0.1:8529" to make HTTPs request in your own browser. The operation can be simply accessing the 127.0.0.1:8529 by your local browser.
- After accessing this IP:port, a login site will occur in your browser.
- Use login name as "root" and password as "" to login.
- After logged in, add a new graph named "allston" in graph page, with edge definition as "freqs", from collection as "words" and to collection as "words".
- Then simply run the GUI.java in "src/main/java/ec504Group3/GUI/" directory to get the GUI running
- The crawler original URL could be changed in input
- The checker original path could be changed in input
- The checker file can be put into "src/main/java/ec504Group3/Resource/CheckerFile/" or "external/taggers/input/" directory and be claimed and checked in GUI.java
