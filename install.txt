        For Mac OS:
            Homebrew
            When installing ArangoDB via the macOS package manager Homebrew, only the Community Edition is available.

            The Homebrew installation is updated a few days after the official release of a new version.

            If you are using homebrew, then you can install the latest released stable version of ArangoDB using brew as follows:

            brew install arangodb
            This will install the current stable version of ArangoDB and all dependencies within your Homebrew tree. Note that the server will be installed as:

            /usr/local/Cellar/arangodb/<VERSION>/sbin/arangod
            <VERSION> is a placeholder for the actual version number, e.g. 3.5.0.

            You can start the server by running the command:

            /usr/local/Cellar/arangodb/<VERSION>/sbin/arangod &
            Configuration file is located at:

            /usr/local/etc/arangodb3/arangod.conf
            The ArangoDB shell will be installed as:

            /usr/local/Cellar/arangodb/<VERSION>/bin/arangosh
            You can uninstall ArangoDB using:

            brew uninstall arangodb
            However, in case you started ArangoDB using the launchctl, you need to unload it before uninstalling the server:

            launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.arangodb.plist
            Then remove the LaunchAgent:

            rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.arangodb.plist
            If the latest ArangoDB version is not shown in Homebrew, you also need to update Homebrew executing the command brew update.

    Windows:
        please follow the instructions on the website:
